The code written here in python does some image processing on the chest xray images to obtain some meaningful results. Operations like 
gamma correction, finding histogram of the image, histogram equalization, adaptive histogram equalization (AHE), contrast limited adaptive 
histogram equalization (CLAHE) are performed on four images of chest xrays.
